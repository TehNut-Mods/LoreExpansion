Version 1.1.2
------------------------------------------------------

- The core configuration can now be edited ingame using the Forge ConfigGUI system.
- Command sender now uses the modid for it's name instead of the modname
- Themes are now extracted from the mod jar at startup.
    - Currently there's only the tech and default themes.
    - More to come, soon-ish.

------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1.1
------------------------------------------------------

- Re-implemented some functions from the 1.7.10 version
    - `hidden`: Hides the entry from the Journal
    - `default`: New players will start with Lore marked with this
    - `notify`: Whether or not to display the notification text when Lore is obtained
    - `action`: In 1.7.10, this was limited to commands. In 1.10 and above, it will be expandable to almost anything.
        - I'd suggest holding off on using this until I re-add the command delay feature.
- Journal text is now wrapped in an `ITextComponent` on a per-line basis.
    - This means that Minecraft's formatting codes (http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Formatting_codes) can be used.

Version 1.1.0

- Port to 1.10.2
- Now maintained by TehNut
- Drastically changed the json format. See the wiki for details
- Added a more powerful trigger system so that lore can be provided to players after specific requirements are met.
